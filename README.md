# File_Organizer

We can organise files inside of a given folder using this script that i have written.

The files are organised based on their file extensions and they are put into seperate folders and then a new "organised folder" is made.

List of All the commands:
                 pls tree "directoryPath" \n
                 pls organize "directoryPath" \n
                 pls help
